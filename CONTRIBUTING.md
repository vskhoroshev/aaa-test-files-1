# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

We would love for you to contribute to the project and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)
 - [Got a Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Found a Bug?](#bug)
 - [Missing a Feature?](#feature)
 - [Submitting an Issue](#issue)
 - [Submitting a Pull Request (PR)](#pull-request)

## <a name="code-of-conduct"></a> Code of Conduct

Please note that this project adheres to a [Contributor Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using [GitHub Discussions][discussions] to ask support-related questions.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to discussions.

## <a name="bug"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#issue) to our GitHub Repository.
Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#pull-request) with a fix.

We want to fix all the bugs as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug, we need to reproduce and confirm it.
In order to reproduce bugs, we require that you provide a minimal reproduction.
Having a minimal reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back and forth to you with additional questions.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you, we are going to close an issue that doesn't have enough info to be reproduced.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can request a new feature by [submitting an issue](#issue) to our GitHub Repository.

For a new feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

## <a name="issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker.
An issue for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

## <a name="pull-request"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit a Pull Request, please search an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.
You don't want to duplicate existing efforts.
