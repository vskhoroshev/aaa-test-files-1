## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

We would love for you to contribute to the project and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

### Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using GitHub discussions to ask support-related questions.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to discussions.

### Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.
Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.
