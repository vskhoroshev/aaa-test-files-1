Thanks for your interest in contributing!

We would love for you to contribute to the project and help make it even better than it is today!
As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

## <a name="code-of-conduct"></a> Code of Conduct

Please note that this project adheres to a [Contributor Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
Instead, we recommend using [GitHub Discussions][discussions] to ask support-related questions.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to discussions.

## <a name="bug"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](#issue) to our GitHub Repository.
Even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#pull-request) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
